## Working Group Information

Discussion of this work occurs on the [Secure Asset Transfer Protocol
Working Group mailing list](mailto:sat@ietf.org)
([archive](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/sat/),
[subscribe](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/sat)).
In addition to contributions in GitHub, you are encouraged to participate in
discussions there.

**Note**: Some working groups adopt a policy whereby substantive discussion of
technical issues needs to occur on the mailing list.

## Getting Started

This repository includes Makefile targets to streamline the development process and ensure code quality. For a quick start:

1. **Fork the repository** - Create your own fork of this repository
2. **Run setup** - Execute `make setup` to install required dependencies and tools
3. **Implement draft changes** - Make your modifications to the draft documents
4. **Run linting** - Execute `make lint-fix` to check and fix formatting issues
5. **Push changes** - Commit and push your changes to your fork
6. **Create a Pull Request** - Open a PR to propose your changes

The Makefile provides several useful targets:
- `make setup` - Downloads and configures development tools (Ruby, editorconfig-checker)
- `make lint-fix` - Runs editorconfig-checker to validate formatting and style
- `make` - Builds formatted text and HTML versions of the draft

These tools help maintain consistent formatting and catch common issues before submission.

## Process
The collaboration process follows standard engineering and open-source practices. To contribute to this draft, create a fork of the repo, do your changes, and open a pull request. A discussion will happen on the PR thread. Upon approval (contingent to the decision of the WP), the PR is merged and your changes are incorporated on the main draft. Detailed instructions:

1. Please [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

2. Add 'upstream' repo to list of remotes
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/ietf-satp/draft-ietf-satp-core`.

3. Verify the new remote named 'upstream'
`git remote -v`. You should now have an `origin` remote (your fork), and the `upstream`.

4. (optional) Run these commands whenever you want to synchronize with the main branch:

        git fetch upstream
        git checkout main
        git rebase upstream/main

5.  Create and checkout your branch.
        `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`

6. Do your changes to the draft. The draft is in [IETF Markdown format](https://authors.ietf.org/en/drafting-in-markdown).

7. Commit changes to your branch.
# Commit and push your changes to your fork

    git add -A
    git commit -s -m "docs(DRAFT_NAME): DESCRIPTION"
    git push origin BRANCH_NAME

8. [Create a Pull Request on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

9. Discussion takes place.
