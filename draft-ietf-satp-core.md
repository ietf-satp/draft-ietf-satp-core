--- abstract

This memo describes the Secure Asset Transfer (SAT) Protocol for digital assets. SAT is a protocol operating between two gateways that conducts the transfer of a digital asset from one gateway to another. The protocol establishes a secure channel between the endpoints and implements a 2-phase commit (2PC) to ensure the properties of transfer atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.

# Introduction

{: #introduction-doc}

This memo proposes a secure asset transfer protocol (SATP) that is intended to be deployed between two gateway endpoints to transfer a digital asset from an origin network to a destination network.

Both the origin and destination networks are assumed to be opaque
in the sense that the interior constructs of a given network
is not read/write accessible to unauthorized entities.

The protocol utilizes the asset burn-and-mint paradigm whereby the asset
to be transferred is permanently disabled or destroyed (burned)
at the origin network and is re-generated (minted) at the destination network.
This is achieved through the coordinated actions of the peer gateways
handling the unidirectional transfer at the respective networks.

A gateway is assumed to be trusted to perform the tasks involved in the asset transfer.

The overall aim of the protocol is to ensure that the state of assets
in the origin and destination networks remain consistent,
and that asset movements into (out of) networks via gateways can be accounted for.

There are several desirable technical properties of the protocol.
The protocol must ensure that the properties of atomicity, consistency,
isolation, and durability (ACID) are satisfied.

The requirement of consistency implies that the
asset transfer protocol always leaves both networks
in a consistent state (that the asset is located in
one system/network only at any time).

Atomicity means that the protocol must guarantee
that either the transfer commits (completes) or entirely fails,
where failure is taken to mean there is no change to the
state of the asset in the origin (sender) network.

The property of isolation means that while a transfer
is occurring to a digital asset from an origin network,
no other state changes can occur to the asset.

The property of durability means that once
the transfer has been committed by both gateways,
that this commitment must hold regardless of subsequent
unavailability (e.g. crash) of the gateways implementing the SAT protocol.

All messages exchanged between gateways are assumed to run over TLS1.2,
and the endpoints at the respective gateways are associated with
a certificate indicating the legal owner (or operator) of the gateway.

# The Secure Asset Transfer Protocol

{: #satp-protocol}

## Overview

{: #satp-overview}

The Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) is a gateway-to-gateway protocol used by a sender gateway with a recipient gateway to perform a unidirectional transfer of a digital asset.

The protocol defines a number of API endpoints, resources and identifier definitions, and message flows corresponding to the asset transfer between the two gateways.

The current document pertains to the interaction between gateways through API2.

{: #satp-fig-overview}

## SAT Model

{: #satp-model}

The model for SATP is shown in Figure 1.
The Client (application) interacts with its local gateway (G1) over an interface (API1) in order to provide instructions to the gateway with regards to actions to assets and related resources located in the local system or network (NW1).

Gateways interact with each other over a gateway interface (API2). A given gateway may be required to access resources that are not located in network NW1 or network NW2. Access to these types of resources are performed over an off-network interface (API3).

## Family of APIs

{: #satp-apitypes}

The following are the types of APIs in SATP:

- Gateway APIs for client (API1):
  This is the API that allows a Client (application) to interact with a local gateway and issue instructions for actions pertaining to resources accessible to the gateway.

- Gateway APIs for peer gateways (API2):
  These are the APIs employed by two (2) peer gateways for performing unidirectional asset transfers.

- APIs for validation of off-network resources (API3):
  These are the APIs made available by a resource server (resource owner) that a gateway can use to access resources.

The use of these APIs is dependent on the mode of access and the type of flow in question.

## Stages of the Protocol

{: #satp-flowtypes}

The SAT protocol defines three (3) stages for a unidirectional asset transfer:

- Transfer Initiation stage (Stage-1):
  These flows deals with commencing a transfer from one gateway to another. Several tasks are involved, including (but not limited to):
  (i) gateway identification and mutual authentication;
  (ii) exchange of asset type (definition) information;
  (iii) verification of the asset definition, and others.

- Lock-Assertion stage (Stage-2):
  These flows deals with the conveyance of signed assertions from the sender gateway to the receiver gateway regarding the locked status of an asset at the origin network.

- Commitment Establishment stage (Stage-3):
  These flowsdeals with the asset transfer and commitment establishment between two gateways.

In order to clarify discussion, the interactions between the peer gateways prior to transfer initiation stage is referred to as the setup stage (Stage-0), which is outside the scope of the current specification.

These flows will be discussed below.

## Gateway Cryptographic Keys

SATP recognizes the following cryptographic keys which are intended for distinct purposes within the different stages of the protocol.

- Gateway signature public key-pair: This is the key-pair utilized by a gateway to digitally sign assertions and receipts.

- Gateway secure channel establishment public key-pair: This is the key-pair utilized by peer gateways to establish a secure channel (e.g. TLS) for a transfer session.

- Gateway device-identity public key pair: This is the key-pair that identifies the unique hardware device underlying a gateway.

- Gateway owner-identity public key pair: This is the key-pair that identifies the owner (e.g. legal entity) who is the legal owner of a gateway.

# SATP Message Format, identifiers and Descriptors

{: #satp-messages-identifiers}

## Overview

{: #satp-message-identifier-overview}

This section describes the SATP message-types, the format of the messages exchanged between two gateways, the format for resource descriptors and other related parameters.

The mandatory fields are determined by the message type exchanged between the two gateways (see Section 7).

## SATP Message Format and Payloads

{: #satp-message-format}

SATP messages are exchanged between peer gateways, where depending on the message type one gateway may act as a client of the other (and vice versa).

### Protocol version

This refers to SATP protocol Version, encoded as "major.minor" (separated by a period symbol).

### Message Type

This refers to the type of request or response to be conveyed in the message.

The possible values are:

- transfer-proposal-msg: This is the transfer proposal message from the sender gateway carrying the set of proposed parameters for the transfer.

- proposal-receipt-msg: This is the signed receipt message indicating acceptance of the proposal by the receiver gateway.

- proposal-counter-msg: This is a counteroffer message from the receiver gateway indicating an alternative proposal.

- transfer-commence-msg: Request to begin the commencement of the asset transfer.

- ack-commence-msg: Response to accept to the commencement of the asset transfer.

- lock-assert-msg: Sender gateway has performed the lock of the asset in the origin network.

- assertion-receipt-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving of the signed lock-assert-msg.

- commit-prepare-msg: Sender gateway requests the start of the commitment stage.

- ack-prepare-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving the previous commit-prepare-msg and agrees to start the commitment stage.

- commit-final-msg: Sender gateway has performed the extinguishment (burn) of the asset in the origin network.

- ack-commit-final-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving of the signed commit-final-msg and has performed the asset creation and assignment in the destination network.

- commit-transfer-complete-msg: Sender gateway indicates closure of the current transfer session.

### Digital Asset Identifier

This is the unique identifier (e.g. UUIDv2) that uniquely identifies the digital asset in the origin network which is to be transferred to the destination network.

The digital asset identifier is a value that is derived by the applications utilized by the originator and the beneficiary prior to starting the asset transfer.

The mechanism used to derive the digital asset identifier is outside the scope of the current document.

### Transfer-Context ID:

This is the unique immutable identifier (e.g. UUIDv2) representing the application layer context of a single unidirectional transfer. The transfer-context is a complex data structure (e.g. in JSON format) that contains all information related to a SATP execution instance. Examples of information contained in a transfer-context may include identifiers of sessions, gateways, networks or assets related to the specific SATP execution instance. Typically, a transfer-context may be retrieved from a Registry via an API3 call

### Session ID:

This is the unique identifier (e.g. UUIDv2) representing a session between two gateways handling a single unidirectional transfer. This may be derived from the Transfer-Context ID at the application level. There may be several session IDs related to a SATP execution instance. Only one Session ID may be active for a given SATP execution instance. Session IDs may be stored in the transfer-context for audit trail purposes.

Sequence Number:

This is an increasing counter uniquely representing a message from a session. This can be utilized to assist the peer gateways when they are processing multiple simultaneous unrelated transfers.

### Gateway Credential Type

This is the type of authentication mechanism supported by the gateway (e.g. SAML, OAuth, X.509)

### Gateway Credential

This payload is the actual credential of the gateway (token, certificate, string, etc.).

### Payload Hash

This is the hash of the current message payload.

### Signature Algorithms Supported

This is the list of digital signature algorithm supported by a gateway, with the base default being the NIST ECDSA standard.

### Message Signature

This payload is the actual the ECDSA signature portion over a message.

## Negotiation of Security Protocols and Parameters

{: #satp-negotiation-params-sec}

The peer gateways in SATP must establish a TLS session between them prior to starting the transfer initiation stage (Stage-0). The TLS session continues until the transfer is completed at the end of the commitment establishment stage (Stage-3).

In the following, the sender gateway is referred to as the client while the received gateway as the server.

### TLS Secure Channel Establishment

{: #satp-tls-Established-sec}

TLS 1.2 or higher MUST be implemented to protect gateway communications. TLS 1.3 or higher SHOULD be implemented where both gateways support TLS 1.3 or higher.

### Client offers supported credential schemes

{: #satp-client-offers-sec}

The  client sends a JSON block containing the supported credential schemes, such as OAuth2.0 or SAML, in the "Credential Scheme" field of the SATP message.

### Server selects supported credential scheme

{: #satp-server-selects-sec}

The server (recipient Gateway) selects one acceptable credential scheme from the offered schemes, returning the selection in the "Credential Scheme" field of the SATP message. If no acceptable credential scheme was offered, an HTTP 511 "Network Authentication Required" error is returned.

### Client asserts or proves identity

{: #client-procedure-sec}

The details of the assertion/verification step are specific to the chosen credential scheme and are outside the scope of this document.

### Sequence numbers initialized

{: #sequence-numbers-sec}

Sequence numbers are used to allow the server to correctly order operations from the client. Some operations may be asynchronous, synchronous, or idempotent with duplicate requests handled differently according to the use case. The initial sequence number is proposed by the client (sender gateway) after credential verification is finalized. The server (receiver gateway) MUST respond with the same sequence number to indicate acceptance. The client increments the sequence number with each new request. Sequence numbers can be reused for retries in the event of a gateway timeout.

### Messages can now be exchanged

{: #satp-msg-exchnge-sec}

Handshaking is complete at this point, and the client can send SAT messages to perform actions on resources, which MAY reference the SAT Payload field.

## Asset Profile Identification

{: #satp-asset-profile-negotiation}

The client and server must mutually agree on the asset type or profile that is the subject of the current transfer. The client provides the server with the asset identification number, or the server may provide the client with the asset identification numbers for the digital asset it supports. Formal specification of asset identification is outside the scope of this document. Globally numbering digital asset types or profiles is expected to be performed by a legally recognized entity.

# Overview of Message Flows

{: #satp-flows-overview-section}

The SATP message flows are logically divided into three (3) stages, with the preparatory stage denoted as Stage-0. How the tasks are achieved in Stage-0 is out of scope for the current specification.

The Stage-1 flows pertains to the initialization of the transfer between the two gateways.

After both gateways agree to commence the transfer at the start of Stage-2, the sender gateway G1 must deliver a signed assertion that it has performed the correct lock (burn) on the asset in origin network (NW1).

If that assertion is accepted by gateway G2, it must in return transmit a signed receipt to gateway G1 that it has created (minted) a temporary asset in destination network (NW2).

The Stage-3 flows commits gateways G1 and G2 to the burn and mint in Stage-2.  The sender gateway G1 must make the lock on the asset in origin network NW1 to be permanent (burn). The receiver gateway G2 must assign (mint) the asset in the destination network NW2 to the correct beneficiary.

The reader is directed to [SATP-ARCH] for further discussion of this model.

# Identity and Asset Verification Stage (Stage 0)

{: #satp-Stage0-section}

Prior to commencing the asset transfer from the sender gateway (client) to the recipient gateway (server), both gateways must perform a number of verifications steps. The types of information required by both the sender and recipient are use-case dependent and asset-type dependent.

The verifications include, but not limited to, the following:

- Verification of the gateway signature public key: The sender gateway and receiver gateway must validate their respective signature public keys that will later be used to sign assertions and claims. This may include validating the X509 certificates of these keys.

- Gateway owner verification:
  This is the verification of the identity (e.g. LEI) of the owners of the gateways.

- Gateway device and state validation:
  This is the device attestation evidence [RATS]
  that a gateway must collect and convey to each other,
  where a verifier is assumed to be available to decode,
  parse and appraise the evidence.

- Originator and beneficiary identity verification:
  This is the identity and public-key of the entity (originator)
  in the origin network seeking to transfer the asset to
  another entity (beneficiary) in the destination network.

These are considered out of scope in the current specifications,
and are assumed to have been successfully completed prior to
the commencement of the transfer initiation flow.

# Transfer Initiation Stage (Stage 1)

{: #satp-stage1-section}

This section describes the transfer initiation stage, where the sender gateway and the receiver gateway prepare for the start of the asset transfer.

The sender gateway proposes the set of transfer parameters and asset-related artifacts for the transfer to the receiver gateway. These are contained in the Transfer Initiation Claims.

If the receiver gateway accepts the proposal, it returns a signed receipt message for the proposal indicating it agrees to proceed to the next stage. If the receiver gateway rejects any parameters or artifacts in the proposal, it can provide a counteroffer to the sender gateway by responding with a proposal reject message carrying alternative parameters.

Gateways MUST support the use of the HTTP GET and POST methods
defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] for the endpoint.

Clients (sender gateway) MAY use the HTTP GET or POST methods to send messages

# SATP Session Resumption

{: #satp-session-resume-section}
This section answers the question how can a backup gateway build trust
with the counter party gateway to resume the execution of the protocol,
in the presence of errors and crashes?

Gateways may enter faulty state at any time while execution the protocol.
The faulty state can manifest itself by incorrect behavior,
leading to gateways emitting alerts and errors.

In some instances, gateways may crash.
We employ either the primary-backup or self-healing paradigm,
meaning that the crashed gateway will eventually be replaced
by a functioning one, or recover, respectively.

When a crash occurs, we initiate a recovery procedure by
the backup gateway or the recovered gateway, as defined in the
crash recovery draft {{?I-D.draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery}}.
In either case, if the recovery happenswithin a time period defined as max_timeout (in Stage 2), the recovered gateway triggers a session resumption.
The schema and order of the recovered messages is specified in the crash recovery draft.

In the case where there is no answer from the gateway within the specified max_timeout,
the counter-party gateway rollbacks the process until that stage.
Upon recovery, the crashed gateway learns that the counterparty gateway
has initated a rollback, and it proceeds accordingly (by also initating a rollback).
Note that rollbacks can also happen in case of unresolved errors.

The non-crashed gateway that conducts the rollback tries to communicate
with the crashed gateway from time to time (self healing) or to contact
the backup gateways (primary-backup).
In any case, and upon the completion of a rollback,
the non-crashed gateway sends a ROLLBACK message
to the recovered gateway to notify that a rollback happened.
The recovered gateway should answer with ROLLBACK-ACK.

Since the self-healing recovery process does not require
changes to the protocol (since from the counterparty gateway perspective,
the sender gateway is just taking longer than normal;
there are no new actions done or logs recorded),
we focus on the primary-backup paradigm.

## Primary-Backup Session Resumption

{: #satp-session-resume-section-pb}

Upon a gateway recovering using primary-backup,
a new gateway (recovered gateway) takes over the crashed gateway.
The counter-party gateway assures that the recovered gateway
is legitimate (according to the crash recovery specification).

After the recovery, the gateways exchange information about
their current view of the protocol, since the crashed gateway
may have been in the middle of executing the protocol when it crashed.

After that, the gateways agree on the current state of the protocol.

## Recovery Messages

{: #satp-session-resume-recovery-msg}
We have omitted the logging procedure (only focusing the different messages).
As defined in the crash recovery draft {{?I-D.draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery}},
there are a set of messages that are exchanged between the recovered
gateway and counterparty gateway:

- RECOVER: when a gateway crashes and recovers,
  it sends a RECOVER message to the counterparty gateway,
  informing them of its most recent state.
  The message contains various parameters such as the session ID,
  message type, SATP stage, sequence number,
  a flag indicating if the sender is a backup gateway,
  the new public key if the sender is a backup,
  the timestamp of the last known log entry, and the sender's digital signature.

- RECOVER-UPDATE: Upon receiving the RECOVER message,
  the counterparty gateway sends a RECOVER-UPDATE message.
  This message carries the difference between the log entry
  corresponding to the received sequence number from the
  recovered gateway and the latest sequence number
  (corresponding to the latest log entry).
  The message includes parameters such as the session ID, message type,
  the hash of the previous message, the list of log messages that
  the recovered gateway needs to update, and the sender's digital signature.

- RECOVER-SUCCESS: The recovered gateway responds with
  a RECOVER-SUCCESS message if its logs have been successfully updated.
  If there are inconsistencies detected,
  the recovered gateway initiates a dispute with a RECOVER-DISPUTE message.
  The message parameters include session ID, message type,
  the hash of the previous message, a boolean indicating success,
  a list of hashes of log entries that were appended to the
  recovered gateway log, and the sender's digital signature.

In case the recovery procedure has failed and a rollback process
is needed, the following messages are used:

- ROLLBACK: A gateway that initiates a rollback sends a ROLLBACK message.
  The message parameters include session ID, message type,
  a boolean indicating success, a list of actions performed
  to rollback a state (e.g., UNLOCK, BURN), a list of proofs
  specific to the DLT [SATP], and the sender's digital signature.

- ROLLBACK-ACK: Upon successful rollback, the counterparty
  gateway sends a ROLLBACK-ACK message to the recovered gateway acknowledging
  that the rollback has been performed successfully.
  The message parameters are similar to those of the ROLLBACK message.

# Error Messages

{: #satp-alert-error-messages}
SATP SATP distinguishes between
application driven closures (terminations) and
those caused by errors at the SATP protocol level.

The list of errors and desciption can be found in the Appendix.

```
enum { session_closure(1), nonfatal_error (2) fatal_error(3), (255) } AlertLevel;

enum {
 close_notify(0),
 bad_certificate(42),
 unsupported_certificate(43),
 certificate_revoked(44),
 certificate_expired(45),
 certificate_unknown(46),
 illegal_parameter(47),
 TBD
 (255)
} AlertDescription;

struct {
 AlertLevel level;
 AlertDescription description;
} Alert;
```

{: #fig-error-format}

## Closure Alerts

{: #satp-closure-alerts-section}

The SATP client and server (gateways) must share knowledge that
the transfer connection is ending in order to avoid third party attacks.

(a) close_notify: This alert notifies the recipient that the sender gateway
will not send any more messages on this transfer connection.
Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored.

(b) user_canceled: This alert notifies the recipient that the sender gateway
is canceling the transfer connection for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure.

## Error Alerts

{: #error-alerts-section}
When an error is detected by a SATP gateway, the detecting gateway sends a message to its peer.

Upon transmission or receipt of a fatal alert message, both gateways MUST immediately close the connection.
Whenever a SATP implementation encounters a fatal error condition,
it SHOULD send an appropriate fatal alert and
MUST close the connection without sending or receiving any additional data.

The following error alerts are defined:

- connection_error: There is an error in the TLS session establishment
  (TLS error codes should be reported-up to gateway level)

- bad_certificate: The gateway certificate was corrupt, contained signatures,
  that did not verify correctly, etc.
  (Some common TLS level errors: unsupported_certificate,
  certificate_revoked, certificate_expired, certificate_unknown, unknown_ca).

- protocol_version_error: The SATP protocol version the peer
  has attempted to negotiate is recognized but not supported.

- (Others TBD)

# Security Consideration

{: #satp-Security-Consideration}
Gateways are of particular interest to attackers because
they are a kind of end-to-end pipeline that enable the transferral of
digital assets to external networks or systems.
Thus, attacking a gateway may be attractive to attackers instead of
the network behind a gateway.

As such, hardware hardening technologies and
tamper-resistant crypto-processors (e.g. TPM, Secure Enclaves, SGX)
should be considered for implementations of gateways.

# IANA Consideration

{: #satp-iana-Consideration}

(TBD)

# Appendix A: API1 Considerations

{: #api1-consideration-section}

Prior to entering Stage 1, the peer gateways are assumed to have established a number of parameters for the unidirectional transfer from the sender gateway to the receiver gateway.
These parameters and asset-related artifacts are assumed to be provided to the gateway by the client application that would be requesting the transfer through API1.

A standardized definition for API1 at a gateway enables application vendors to interact with gateways over a stable interface, independent of the implementation of the gateway.Â 
This write-once-deploy-everywhere approach reduces development costs and ensures a high degree of interoperability across different gateway implementations.

In order for client applications to interact with the SATP gateways, we propose the following set of resource descriptors.

## SATP Gateway API1 Resource Descriptors

{: #api1-satp-resource-descriptors-sec}

Gateway resources are identified by URL [RFC1738].

Data included in the URL are as follows.

### Gateway / Endpoint ID

{: #api1-satp-gateway-id-sec}

FQDN of the SATP compliant gateway. Required to establish IP connectivity. This MUST resolve to a valid IP address.

### Network or System Identifier

{: #api1-satp-network-id-sec}

Specific to the gateway behind which the target network operates. This field is local to the gateway and is used to direct SATP interactions to the correct underlying network. This value may be alphanumeric or a hexadecimal value.

For example: "example-network", "ethereum-mainnet".

### API Network Resource

{: #api1-satp-network-resource-sec}

Specifies a resource held on the underlying network. This field must be meaningful to the network in question but is otherwise an arbitrary string. The underlying object it points to may be a network address, data block, transaction ID, alias, etc. or a future object type not yet defined.

### Examples

{: #api1-satp-resource-example-sec}

The following example illustrates using the satp-api1.example.com domain name, "example-network" as the network identifier and "asset-transfers" as the resource. 87152a29-f43a-4da6-a6bd-8ba2b7adf14c is the Session ID corresponding to this example asset transfer.

https://satp-api1.example.com/example-network/asset-transfers/87152a29-f43a-4da6-a6bd-8ba2b7adf14c

The next example uses satp-api1.example.com as the domain name, "ethereum-mainnet" as the network identifier and "assets" as the resource. The asset identifier here is a composite made up from the smart contract Id itself (0xc0cf5b82ae2352303b2ea02c3be88e23f2594171) together with the tokenId (22700080087) from the state data that the smart contract saves.

## API1 Client Descriptors

{: #satp-client-resource-descriptor-sec}

## Gateway Level Authentication

We propose that SATP Gateway API1 providers employ the Autho2.0 authentication scheme [RFC6749]. This would ensure enough flexibility for the API1 provider while also providing a consistent model for client application developers to adopt, regardless of the underlying SATP Gateway implementation.

## Gateway Level Authorization

{: #satp-gateway-access-sec}

Gateways can enforce access rules based on the access token they receive through Auth2.0. API1 providers can assign roles to specific Auth2.0 clientIds depending on business requirements.

## Application Profile Negotiation

{: #satp-application-profile-negotiation}

Where an application relies on specific extensions for operation, these can be represented in an Application Profile. For example, a payments application that tracks payments using a cloud-based API and interacts only with gateways logging messages to that API can establish a resource profile as follows:

    Application Name: TRACKER
    X-Tracker_URL: https://api.tracker.com/updates
    X-Tracking-Policy: Always

As gateways implement this functionality, they support the TRACKER application profile, and the application is able to expand its reach by periodically polling for the availability of the profile.

This is an intentionally generalized extension mechanism for application or vendor specific functionality.

## Discovery of Digital Asset Resources

{: #satp-resource-discovery-sec}

Client applications can be located both within the digital asset network or outside the network. Applications located outside a network or system SHOULD be able to discover which resources they are authorized to access.

Resource discovery is handled by the gateway in front of the network. For instance using a GET request against the gateway URL with no resource identifier could return a list of URLs available to the requester. This list is subject to the access controls above.

Gateways MAY allow applications to discover resources they do not have access to. This should be indicated in the free text field, and gateways SHOULD implement a process for applications to request access.

Formal specification of supported resource discovery methods is out of scope of this document.

# Appendix B: API3 Considerations

{: #api3-consideration-section}

Prior to commencing a transfer, gateways are assumed to perform the validation of 
a number of asset-related parameters and actor-related attributes.
For certain classes of assets, the owner (operator) of a gateway takes on legal and financial liabilities 
when assisting in the transfer of a digital asset.
As such, gateway system must not only validate these asset-related parameters and user attributes, 
but it must also log these for regulatory compliance and post-event dispute resolution.

For certain types of parameters (e.g. identity attributes),
standard protocols have been defined and have broad deployment (e.g. X.509 CA/RA, OAuth2.0, OpenID-Connect).
In these cases, the gateway operator should utilize as far as possible these existing standards.

For payments using existing fiat denominations, standard protocols and APIs have also been defined
and deployed broadly (e.g. Open Banking, ACH gateways, other card-payments APIs).

For new types of digital assets (e.g. asset-referencing tokens or ART [MICA2013]) a receiver gateway may need to validate the relevant off-chain information regarding the underlying (physical) asset. 
A standardized interface to these off-chain databases will be required.
