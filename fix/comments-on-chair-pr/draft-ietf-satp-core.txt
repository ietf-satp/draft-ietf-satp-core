               Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) Core
                      draft-ietf-satp-core-latest

Abstract

   This memo describes the Secure Asset Transfer (SAT) Protocol for
   digital assets.  SAT is a protocol operating between two gateways
   that conducts the transfer of a digital asset from one gateway to
   another, each representing their corresponding digital asset
   networks.  The protocol establishes a secure channel between the
   endpoints and implements a 2-phase commit (2PC) to ensure the
   properties of transfer atomicity, consistency, isolation and
   durability.

1.  Introduction

   This memo proposes a secure asset transfer protocol (SATP) that is
   intended to be deployed between two gateway endpoints to transfer a
   digital asset from an origin asset network to a destination asset
   network.  Readers are directed first to [ARCH] for a description of
   the architecture underlying the current protocol.

   Both the origin and destination asset networks are assumed to be
   opaque in the sense that the interior construct of a given network is
   not read/write accessible to unauthorized entities.

   The protocol utilizes the asset burn-and-mint paradigm whereby the
   asset to be transferred is permanently disabled or destroyed (burned)
   at the origin asset network and is re-generated (minted) at the
   destination asset network.  This is achieved through the coordinated
   actions of the peer gateways handling the unidirectional transfer at
   the respective networks.

   A gateway is assumed to be trusted to perform the tasks involved in
   the asset transfer.

   The overall aim of the protocol is to ensure that the state of assets
   in the origin and destination networks remain consistent, and that
   asset movements into (out of) networks via gateways can be accounted
   for.

   There are several desirable technical properties of the protocol.
   The protocol must ensure that the properties of atomicity,
   consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) are satisfied.

   The requirement of consistency implies that the asset transfer
   protocol always leaves both asset networks in a consistent state
   (that the asset is located in one system/network only at any time).

   Atomicity means that the protocol must guarantee that either the
   transfer commits (completes) or entirely fails, where failure is
   taken to mean there is no change to the state of the asset in the
   origin (sender) asset network.

   The property of isolation means that while a transfer is occurring to
   a digital asset from an origin network, no other state changes can
   occur to the asset.

   The property of durability means that once the transfer has been
   committed by both gateways, that this commitment must hold regardless
   of subsequent unavailability (e.g. crash) of the gateways
   implementing the SAT protocol.

   All messages exchanged between gateways are assumed to run over
   TLS1.2 or higher, and the endpoints at the respective gateways are
   associated with a certificate indicating the legal owner (or
   operator) of the gateway.  HTTPS/S must be used intead of plain HTTP.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [REQ-LEVEL].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

3.  Terminology

   The following are some terminology used in the current document, some
   borrowed from [NIST]:

   *  Digital asset: digital representation of a value or of a right
      that is able to be transferred and stored electronically using
      distributed ledger technology or similar technology [MICA].

   *  Asset network: A monolithic system or a set of distributed systems
      that manage digital assets.

   *  Client application: This is the application employed by a user to
      interact with a gateway.

   *  Gateway: The computer system functionally capable of acting as a
      gateway in an asset transfer.

   *  Sender gateway: The gateway that initiates a unidirectional asset
      transfer.

   *  Recipient gateway: The gateway that is the recipient side of a
      unidirectional asset transfer.

   *  Claim: An assertion made by an Entity [JWT].

   *  Claim Type: Syntax used for representing a Claim Value [JWT].

   *  Gateway Claim: An assertion made by a Gateway regarding the status
      or condition of resources (e.g. assets, public keys, etc.)
      accessible to that gateway (e.g. within its asset network or
      system).

   In the remainder of this document, for brevity of description the
   term “asset network” will often be shorted to "network".

4.  The Secure Asset Transfer Protocol

4.1.  Overview

   The Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP) is a gateway-to-gateway
   protocol used by a sender gateway with a recipient gateway to perform
   a unidirectional transfer of a digital asset.

   The protocol defines a number of API endpoints, resources and
   identifier definitions, and message flows corresponding to the asset
   transfer between the two gateways.

   The current document pertains to the interaction between gateways
   through API2 [ARCH].

   +----------+ +----------+ | Client | | Off-net | ------ | (App) | |
   Resource | | +----------+ +----------+ | | | API3 | | |
   +----------+ | | ^ | V | | +---------+ | V | API1 | | +-----+
   +---------+----+ +----+---------+ +-----+ | | | | | | | | | | |
   Net.| | Gateway |API2| |API2| Gateway | | Net.| | NW1 |---|
   G1 | |<------>| | G2 |---| NW2 | | | | | | | | | | | +-----+
   +---------+----+ +----+---------+ +-----+ Figure 1

4.2.  SAT Model

   The model for SATP is shown in Figure 1 [ARCH].  The Client
   (application) interacts with its local gateway (G1) over an interface
   (API1) in order to provide instructions to the gateway with regards
   to actions to assets and related resources located in the local
   system or network (NW1).

   Gateways interact with each other over a gateway interface (API2).  A
   given gateway may be required to access resources that are not
   located in network NW1 or network NW2.  Access to these types of
   resources are performed over an off-network interface (API3).

4.3.  Stages of the Protocol

   The SAT protocol defines three (3) stages for a unidirectional asset
   transfer:

   *  Transfer Initiation stage (Stage-1): These flows deal with
      commencing a transfer from one gateway to another.  In this stage
      the sender gateway delivers a proposal containing the parameters
      agreed upon in Stage-0.

   *  Lock-Assertion stage (Stage-2): These flows deal with the
      conveyance of signed assertions from the sender gateway to the
      receiver gateway regarding the locked status of an asset at the
      origin network.

   *  Commitment Preparation and Finalization stage (Stage-3): These
      flows deal with the asset transfer and commitment establishment
      between two gateways.

   In order to clarify discussion, the interactions between the peer
   gateways prior to the transfer initiation stage is referred to as the
   setup stage (Stage-0), which is outside the scope of the current
   specification.

   The Stage-1, Stage-2 and Stage-3 flows will be discussed below.

4.4.  Gateway Cryptographic Keys

   SATP recognizes the following cryptographic keys which are intended
   for distinct purposes within the different stages of the protocol.

   *  Gateway signature public key-pair: This is the key-pair utilized
      by a gateway to digitally sign assertions and receipts.

   *  Gateway secure channel establishment public key-pair: This is the
      key-pair utilized by peer gateways to establish a secure channel
      (e.g. TLS) for a transfer session.

   *  Gateway identity public key pair: This is the key-pair that
      uniquely identifies a gateway.

   *  Gateway-owner identity public key pair: This is the key-pair that
      identifies the owner (e.g. legal entity) who is the legal owner of
      a gateway.

   This document assumes that the relevant X.509 certificates are
   associated with these keys.  However, the mechanisms to obtain X.509
   certificates is outside the scope of this specification.

5.  SATP Message Format, identifiers and Descriptors

5.1.  Overview

   This section describes the SATP message-types, the format of the
   messages exchanged between two gateways, the format for resource
   descriptors and other related parameters.

   The mandatory fields are determined by the message type exchanged
   between the two gateways (see Section 7).

5.2.  SATP Message Digital Signatures

   All SATP messages exchanged between gateways must be signed, using
   JSON Web Signatures mechanism (RFC7515).

   All gateways implementing SATP must support the "ES256" from the IANA
   "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry [JWA], which
   is the ECDSA signature algorithm with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256
   hash function.

   Additional signature algorithms and keying parameters may be
   negotiated by peer gateways.  However, the negotiation protocol is
   outside the scope of this specification.

5.3.  SATP Message Format and Payloads

   SATP messages are exchanged between peer gateways, where depending on
   the message type one gateway may act as a client of the other (and
   vice versa).

   All SATP messages exchanged between gateways are in JSON format
   [JSON].

5.3.1.  Protocol version

   This refers to SATP protocol Version, encoded as "major.minor"
   (separated by a period symbol).

   The current version is "1.0" defined in this specification.
   Implementations not understanding a future option value should return
   an appropriate error response and cease the negotiation.

5.3.2.  Message Type

   This refers to the type of request or response to be conveyed in the
   message.

   The possible values are defined in the IANA SATP Message Types
   Registry Section 14.3, Paragraph 1:

   *  transfer-proposal-msg: This is the transfer proposal message from
      the sender gateway carrying the set of proposed parameters for the
      transfer.

   *  proposal-receipt-msg: This is the signed receipt message
      indicating acceptance of the proposal by the receiver gateway.

   *  reject-msg: This is a reject message from a gateway to the peer
      gateway in the session, indication the reason and the resulting
      action.

   *  transfer-commence-msg: Request to begin the commencement of the
      asset transfer.

   *  ack-commence-msg: Response to accept the commencement of the asset
      transfer.

   *  lock-assert-msg: Sender gateway has performed the lock of the
      asset in the origin network.

   *  assertion-receipt-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving the
      signed lock-assert-msg.

   *  commit-prepare-msg: Sender gateway requests the start of the
      commitment stage.

   *  ack-prepare-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving the
      previous commit-prepare-msg and agrees to start the commitment
      stage.

   *  commit-final-msg: Sender gateway has performed the extinguishment
      (burn) of the asset in the origin network.

   *  ack-commit-final-msg: Receiver gateway acknowledges receiving the
      signed commit-final-msg and has performed the asset creation and
      assignment in the destination network.

   *  commit-transfer-complete-msg: Sender gateway indicates closure of
      the current transfer session.

   *  error-msg: This message is used to indicate that an error has
      occured at the SATP layer.  It can be transmitted by either
      gateways.

   *  session-abort-msg: This message is used by a gateway to abort the
      current session.

5.3.3.  Digital Asset Identifier

   This is the identifier that uniquely identifies the digital asset in
   the origin network which is to be transferred to the destination
   network.

   The digital asset identifier is a value that is derived by the
   applications utilized by the originator and the beneficiary prior to
   starting the asset transfer.

   The mechanism used to derive the digital asset identifier is outside
   the scope of the current document.

5.3.4.  Asset Profile Identifier

   This is the unique identifier of the asset schema or asset profile
   which defines the class or type of asset in question.  The asset
   profile is relevant from a regulatory perspective.

   In some cases the profile identifier may be needed by the receiver
   gateway at the destination network in order to evaluate whether the
   asset is permitted to enter the destination network.

   The formal specification of asset profiles and their identification
   is outside the scope of this document.

5.3.5.  Transfer-Context ID:

   This is the unique immutable identifier representing the application
   layer context of a single unidirectional transfer.  The method to
   generate the transfer-context ID is outside the scope of the current
   document.

   The transfer-context may be a complex data structure that contains
   all information related to a SATP execution instance.  Examples of
   information contained in a transfer-context may include identifiers
   of sessions, gateways, networks or assets related to the specific
   SATP execution instance.

   The sender gateway provides this value to the receiver gateway.
   Mechanisms to establish this value between the sender and receiver
   gateways may be utilized prior commencing the SAT protocol.
   Specifically, these are expected to be negated prior to the
   establishment of the SAT protocol and are out of scope for this
   document.

5.3.6.  Session ID:

   This is the unique identifier representing a session between two
   gateways handling a single unidirectional transfer.  This may be
   derived from the Transfer-Context ID at the application level.  There
   may be several session IDs related to a SATP execution instance.
   Only one Session ID may be active for a given SATP execution
   instance.  Session IDs may be stored in the transfer-context for
   audit trail purposes.

   The sender gateway provides this value to the receiver gateway.

5.3.7.  Gateway Credential Type

   This is the type of authentication mechanism supported by the gateway
   (e.g. SAML, OAuth, X.509)

5.3.8.  Gateway Credential

   This payload is the actual credential of the gateway (token,
   certificate, string) with a string based encoding based on the
   corresponding Gateway Credential Type.

5.3.9.  Gateway Identifier

   This is the unique identifier of the gateway service.  The gateway
   identifier MUST be uniquely bound to its SAT endpoint (e.g. via X.509
   certificates).

   This gateway identifier is distinct from the gateway operator
   business identifier (e.g., legal entity identifier (LEI) number).  A
   gateway operator may operate multiple gateways.  Each of the gateways
   within an asset network MUST be identified by a unique gateway
   identifier.

   The mechanisms to establish the gateway identifier or the operator
   identifier is outside the scope of this specification.

5.3.10.  Payload Hash

   This is the hash of the current message payload.

5.3.11.  Signature Algorithms Supported

   This is a JSON list of digital signature algorithms supported by a
   gateway.  Each entry in the list should be either an Algorithm Name
   value registered in the IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption
   Algorithms" registry established by [JWA] or be a value that contains
   a Collision-Resistant Name.

   All implementations MUST support a common default of "ES256", which
   is the ECDSA signature algorithm with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256
   hash function.

5.3.12.  Lock assertion Claim Format

   This is the format of the claim regarding the state of the asset in
   the origin network.

   The claim is network-dependent in the sense that different asset
   networks or systems may utilize a different asset locking
   (disablement) mechanism.

   The sender gateway provides the choice of the format to the receiver
   gateway.  Mechanisms to establish this value between the sender and
   receiver gateways may be utilized prior commencing the SAT protocol.
   Specifically, these are expected to be negated prior to the
   establishment of the SAT protocol and are out of scope for this
   document.

5.3.13.  Lock assertion Claim

   The actual encoded JSON string representation of the claim using the
   format as specified by the corresponding Lock assertion Claim Format.

5.4.  Negotiation of Security Protocols and Parameters

   The peer gateways in SATP must establish a TLS session between them
   prior to starting the transfer initiation stage (Stage-0).  The TLS
   session continues until the transfer is completed at the end of the
   commitment establishment stage (Stage-3).

   In the following steps, the sender gateway is referred to as the
   client while the receiver gateway as the server.

5.4.1.  TLS Secure Channel Establishment

   TLS 1.2 or higher MUST be implemented to protect gateway
   communications.  TLS 1.3 or higher SHOULD be used where both gateways
   support TLS 1.3 or higher.

5.4.2.  Client offers supported credential schemes

   Prior to commecing the TLS 1.3 secure channel establishment, the
   client (sender gateway) may choose to send a JSON block containing
   information regarding the client's supported credential schemes.

   The purpose of the credential scheme is to enable the client to
   deliver to server the relevant identity information in that scheme
   regarding the gateway-identity and gateway-owner identity
   information.

5.4.3.  Server selects supported credential scheme

   If the client (sender gateway) transmits a list of supported
   credential schemes, the server (recipient gateway) selects one
   acceptable credential scheme from the offered schemes.

   If no acceptable credential scheme was offered, a "unsupported
   gatewayCredentialProfile" (err_1.1.34) reject message is returned by
   the server Section 8.5, Paragraph 1.

5.4.4.  Client asserts or proves identity

   The details of the assertion/verification step are specific to the
   chosen credential scheme and are outside the scope of this document.

5.4.5.  Messages can now be exchanged

   Handshaking is complete at this point, and the client and server can
   begin exchanging SATP messages.

6.  Overview of Message Flows

   The SATP message flows are logically divided into three (3) stages
   [ARCH], with the preparatory stage denoted as Stage-0.  How the tasks
   are achieved in Stage-0 is out of the scope of this specification.

   The Stage-1 flows pertains to the initialization of the transfer
   between the two gateways.

   After both gateways agree to commence the transfer at the start of
   Stage-2, the sender gateway G1 must deliver a signed assertion that
   it has correctly performed the relevant action on the asset within
   the origin network (NW1).  Examples of actions by G1 include
   performing a temporary lock on the asset, or performing a permanent
   disablement (burn) of the asset in NW1.

   If that signed assertion is accepted by gateway G2, it must in return
   transmit a signed receipt to gateway G1 that it has correctly
   performed the relevant corresponding action on destination network
   (NW2).  Examples of actions by G2 include creating (minting) a
   temporary asset under its control in NW2.

   The Stage-3 flows commit gateways G1 and G2 to the burn and mint in
   Stage-2.  The sender gateway G1 must make the lock on the asset in
   the origin network NW1 to be permanent (burn).  The receiver gateway
   G2 must assign (mint) the asset in the destination network NW2 to the
   correct beneficiary.

   The reader is directed to [ARCH] for further discussion of this
   model.

7.  Identity and Asset Verification Stage (Stage 0)

   Prior to commencing the asset transfer from the sender gateway
   (client) to the recipient gateway (server), both gateways must
   perform a number of verification steps.  The types of information
   required by both the sender and recipient are use-case dependent and
   asset-type dependent.

   The verifications include, but not limited to, the following:

   *  Verification of the gateway signature public key: The sender
      gateway and receiver gateway must validate their respective
      signature public keys that will later be used to sign assertions
      and claims.  This may include validating the X509 certificates of
      these keys.

   *  Gateway owner verification: This is the verification of the
      identity (e.g. LEI) of the owners of the gateways.

   *  Gateway device and state validation: This is the device
      attestation evidence [RFC9334] that a gateway must collect and
      convey to each other, where a verifier is assumed to be available
      to decode, parse and appraise the evidence.

   *  Originator and beneficiary identity verification: This is the
      identity and public-key of the entity (originator) in the origin
      network seeking to transfer the asset to another entity
      (beneficiary) in the destination network.

   These are considered out of scope in the current specification, and
   are assumed to have been successfully completed prior to the
   commencement of the transfer initiation flow.  The reader is directed
   to [ARCH] for further discussion regarding Stage-0.

8.  Transfer Initiation Stage (Stage 1)

   This section describes the transfer initiation stage, where the
   sender gateway and the receiver gateway prepare for the start of the
   asset transfer.

   The sender gateway proposes the set of transfer parameters and asset-
   related artifacts for the transfer to the receiver gateway.  These
   are contained in the Transfer Initiation Claim.

   If the receiver gateway accepts the proposal, it returns a signed
   receipt message for the proposal indicating it agrees to proceed to
   the next stage.  If the receiver gateway rejects any parameters or
   artifacts in the proposal, it can provide a counteroffer to the
   sender gateway by responding with a proposal reject message carrying
   alternative parameters.

   Gateways MUST support the use of the HTTP GET and POST methods
   defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] for the endpoint.

   Clients (sender gateway) MAY use the HTTP GET or POST methods to send
   messages in this stage to the server (recipient gateway).  If using
   the HTTP GET method, the request parameters may be serialized using
   URI Query String Serialization.

   (NOTE: Flows occur over TLS.  Nonces are not shown).

8.1.  Transfer Initialization Claim

   This is set of artifacts pertaining to the asset that must be agreed
   upon between the client (sender gateway) and the server (recipient
   gateway).

   The format of the identity fields in this message, unless otherwise
   stated, is a JSON string that contains a [X.500] Distinguished Name.

   The Transfer Initialization Claim consists of the following:

   *  digitalAssetId REQUIRED: This is the globally unique identifier
      for the digital asset located in the origin network.  The format
      of this JSON string is dependent on the assetProfileId that
      indicates the asset network in which the asset is originating.

   *  assetProfileId REQUIRED: This is the globally unique identifier
      for the asset-profile definition (document) on which the digital
      asset was issued.

      asset.  These can be (i) TIME_LOCK, (ii) HASH_LOCK, (iii)
      HASH_TIME_LOCK.

   *  assetLockExpirationTime OPTIONAL: The duration of time (in
      seconds) for an asset lock to expire in the network, if it is a
      HASH_TIME_LOCK or a TIME_LOCK.

   *  verifiedOriginatorEntityId REQUIRED: This is the identity data of
      the originator entity (person or organization) in the origin
      network.  This information must be verified by the sender gateway.

   *  verifiedBeneficiaryEntityId REQUIRED: This is the identity data of
      the beneficiary entity (person or organization) in the destination
      network.  This information must be verified by the receiver
      gateway.

   *  originatorPubkey REQUIRED: This is the public key of the asset
      owner (originator) in the origin network or system.

   *  beneficiaryPubkey REQUIRED: This is the public key of the
      beneficiary in the destination network.

   *  senderGatewaySignaturePublicKey REQUIRED: This is the public key
      of the key-pair used by the sender gateway to sign assertions and
      receipts.

   *  receiverGatewaySignaturePublicKey REQUIRED: This is the public key
      of the key-pair used by the recevier gateway to sign assertions
      and receipts.

   *  senderGatewayId REQUIRED: This is the identifier of the sender
      gateway.

   *  recipientGatewayId REQUIRED: This is the identifier of the
      receiver gateway.

   *  senderGatewayNetworkId REQUIRED: This is the identifier of the
      origin network or system behind the client.

8.2.  Conveyance of Gateway and Network Capabilities

   This is the set of parameters pertaining to the origin network and
   the destination network, and the technical capabilities supported by
   the peer gateways.  Some of these parameters must be previously
   agreed to during the Stage-0 negotiations, which is outside the scope
   of this document.

   Some network-specific parameters regarding the origin network may be
   relevant for a receiver gateway to evaluate its ability to process
   the proposed transfer.

   The gateway capabilities list is as follows:

   *  gatewayDefaultSignatureAlgorithm REQUIRED: The default digital
      signature algorithm (algorithm-id) from the IANA "JSON Web
      Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry used by a gateway to
      sign claims.

   *  gatewaySupportedSignatureAlgorithms OPTIONAL: The list of other
      digital signature algorithms (algorithm-id) from the IANA "JSON
      Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry supported by a
      gateway to sign claims

   *  networkLockType REQUIRED: The default locking mechanism used by a
      network.  The values allowed are "TIME_LOCK", "HASH_LOCK",
      "HASH_TIME_LOCK".  Future updates to this specification may define
      new values and implementations not supporting a value or not
      understanding a value for this field must return an appropriate
      error and cease the negotiation.

   *  networkLockExpirationTime REQUIRED: The duration of time (in
      integer seconds) for a lock to expire in the network.

   *  gatewayCredentialProfile REQUIRED: Specify type of auth (e.g.,
      SAML, OAuth, X.509).

   *  gatewayLoggingProfile REQUIRED: contains the profile of the
      logging procedure.  "LOCAL_STORE" is the only defined allowed
      value at this time, but others may be defined in future updates to
      this specification.  Implementations not understanding a future
      option value should return an appropriate error response and cease
      the negotiation.

   *  gatewayAccessControlProfile REQUIRED: the profile regarding the
      confidentiality of the log entries being stored.  "RBAC" is the
      only defined allowed value at this time, but others may be defined
      in future updates to this specification.  Implementations not
      understanding a future option value should return an appropriate
      error response and cease the negotiation.  Default is only the
      gateway that created the logs can access them.

   Here is an example representation in JSON format:

   json { "gatewayDefaultSignatureAlgorithm": "ES256",
   "gatewaySupportedSignatureAlgorithms": ["ES256", "RSA"],
   "networkLockType": "HASH_TIME_LOCK", "networkLockExpirationTime":
   120, "gatewayCredentialProfile": "OAUTH", "gatewayLoggingProfile":
   "LOCAL_STORE", "gatewayAccessControlProfile": "RBAC" }

8.3.  Transfer Proposal Message

   The purpose of this message is for the sender gateway as the client
   to initiate an asset transfer session with the receiver gateway as
   the server.

   The client transmits a proposal message that carries the claim
   related to the asset to be transferred.  This message must be signed
   by the client.

   This message is sent from the client to the Transfer Initialization
   Endpoint at the server.

   The parameters of this message consist of the following:

   }\

9.  Lock Assertion Stage (Stage 2)

   The messages in this stage pertain to the sender gateway providing
   the recipient gateway with a signed assertion that the asset in the
   origin network has been locked or disabled and under the control of
   the sender gateway.

   In the following steps, the sender gateway takes the role of the
   client while the recipient gateway takes the role of the server.

   The flow follows a request-response model.  The client makes a
   request (POST) to the Lock-Assertion Endpoint at the server.

   Gateways MUST support the use of the HTTP GET and POST methods
   defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] for the endpoint.

   Clients MAY use the HTTP GET or POST methods to send messages in this
   stage to the server.  If using the HTTP GET method, the request
   parameters may be serialized using URI Query String Serialization.

   (NOTE: Flows occur over TLS.  Nonces are not shown).

9.1.  Lock Assertion Message

   The purpose of this message is for the client (sender gateway) to
   convey a signed claim to the server (receiver gateway) declaring that
   the asset in question has been locked or escrowed by the client in
   the origin network (e.g. to prevent double-spending).

   The format of the claim is dependent on the network or system of the
   client and is outside the scope of this specification.

   This message is sent from the client to the Lock Assertion Endpoint
   at the server.

   The server must validate the claim (payload) in this message prior to
   the next step.

   The message must be signed by the client.

   The parameters of this message consist of the following:

   *  messageType REQUIRED: urn:ietf:satp:msgtype:lock-assert-msg.

   *  sessionId REQUIRED: A unique identifier chosen earlier by the
      client in the Initialization Request Message.

   *  transferContextId REQUIRED: A unique identifier used to identify
      the current transfer session at the application layer.

   *  lockAssertionClaimFormat REQUIRED: The format of the claim.

   *  lockAssertionClaim REQUIRED: The lock assertion claim or statement
      by the client.

   *  lockAssertionExpiration REQUIRED: The expiration date and time
      [DATETIME] of the lock or escrow upon the asset.

   *  hashPrevMessage REQUIRED: The hash of the previous message.

   Example:

   {\ "messageType": "urn:ietf:satp:msgtype:lock-assert-msg",\
   "sessionId": "d66a567c-11f2-4729-a0e9-17ce1faf47c1",\

9.2.  Lock Assertion Receipt Message

   The purpose of this message is for the server (receiver gateway) to
   indicate acceptance of the claim in the lock-assertion message
   delivered by the client (sender gateway) in the previous message.

   This message is sent from the server to the Assertion Receipt
   Endpoint at the client.

   The message must be signed by the server.

   The parameters of this message consist of the following:

   *  messageType REQUIRED: urn:ietf:satp:msgtype:assertion-receipt-msg.

   *  sessionId REQUIRED: A unique identifier chosen earlier by the
      client in the Initialization Request Message.

   *  transferContextId REQUIRED: A unique identifier used to identify
      the current transfer session at the application layer.

   *  hashPrevMessage REQUIRED: The hash of the previous message.

   Example:

   {\ "messageType": "urn:ietf:satp:msgtype:assertion-receipt-msg",\
   "sessionId": "d66a567c-11f2-4729-a0e9-17ce1faf47c1",\
   "transferContextId": "89e04e71-bba2-4363-933c-262f42ec07a0",\

   }\

10.  Commitment Preparation and Finalization (Stage 3)

   This section describes the transfer commitment agreement between the
   client (sender gateway) and the server (receiver gateway).

   This stage must be completed within the time specified in the
   lockAssertionExpiration value in the lock-assertion message.

   In the following steps, the sender gateway takes the role of the
   client while the recipient gateway takes the role of the server.

   The flow follows a request-response model.  The client makes a
   request (POST) to the Transfer Commitment endpoint at the server.

   Gateways MUST support the use of the HTTP GET and POST methods
   defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] for the endpoint.

   Clients MAY use the HTTP GET or POST methods to send messages in this
   stage to the server.  If using the HTTP GET method, the request
   parameters may be serialized using URI Query String Serialization.

   The client and server may be required to sign certain messages in
   order to provide standalone proof (for non-repudiation) independent
   of the secure channel between the client and server.  This proof may
   be required for audit verifications post-event.

   (NOTE: Flows occur over TLS.  Nonces are not shown).

      urn:ietf:satp:msgtype:session-abort-msg.

   *  sessionId REQUIRED: This is the current session in which the abort
      occurs.

   The effect of session aborts on the state of the asset is discussed
   below.

11.  SATP Session Resumption

   This section answers the question of how can a backup gateway build
   trust with the counterparty gateway to resume the execution of the
   protocol, in the presence of errors and crashes?

   Gateways may enter a faulty state at any time while executing the
   protocol.  The faulty state can manifest itself in incorrect
   behavior, leading to gateways emitting alerts and errors.

   In some instances, gateways may crash.  We employ either the primary-
   backup or self-healing paradigm, meaning that the crashed gateway
   will eventually be replaced by a functioning one, or recover,
   respectively.

   When a crash occurs, we initiate a recovery procedure by the backup
   gateway or the recovered gateway, as defined in the crash recovery
   draft [I-D.draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery].  In either case, if
   the recovery happens within a time period defined as max_timeout (in
   Stage 2), the recovered gateway triggers a session resumption.  The
   schema and order of the recovered messages are specified in the crash
   recovery draft.

   In the case where there is no answer from the gateway within the
   specified max_timeout, the counterparty gateway rollbacks the process
   until that stage.  Upon recovery, the crashed gateway learns that the
   counterparty gateway has initiated a rollback, and it proceeds
   accordingly (by also initiating a rollback).  Note that rollbacks can
   also happen in case of unresolved errors.

   The non-crashed gateway that conducts the rollback tries to
   communicate with the crashed gateway from time to time (self-healing)
   or to contact the backup gateways (primary-backup).  In any case,
   upon the completion of a rollback, the non-crashed gateway sends a
   ROLLBACK message to the recovered gateway to notify that a rollback
   happened.  The recovered gateway should answer with ROLLBACK-ACK.

   Since the self-healing recovery process does not require changes to
   the protocol (since from the counterparty gateway perspective, the
   sender gateway is just taking longer than normal; there are no new
   actions done or logs recorded), we focus on the primary-backup
   paradigm.

11.1.  Primary-Backup Session Resumption

   Upon a gateway recovering using primary-backup, a new gateway
   (recovered gateway) takes over the crashed gateway.  The counterparty
   gateway assures that the recovered gateway is legitimate (according
   to the crash recovery specification).

   After the recovery, the gateways exchange information about their
   current view of the protocol, since the crashed gateway may have been
   in the middle of executing the protocol when it crashed.

   After that, the gateways MUST agree on the current state of the
   protocol.

11.2.  Recovery Messages

   We have omitted the logging procedure, as that it is implementation
   dependent to properly log a set of recovery steps needed to
   reconstruct state upon a gateway failure.  As defined in the crash
   recovery draft [I-D.draft-belchior-satp-gateway-recovery], there is a
   set of messages that are exchanged between the recovered gateway and
   counterparty gateway:

   *  RECOVER: when a gateway crashes and recovers, it sends a RECOVER
      message to the counterparty gateway, informing them of its most
      recent state.  The message contains various parameters such as the
      session ID, message type, SATP stage, context ID, a flag
      indicating if the sender is a backup gateway, the new public key
      if the sender is a backup, the timestamp of the last known log
      entry, and the sender's digital signature.

   *  RECOVER-UPDATE: Upon receiving the RECOVER message, the
      counterparty gateway sends a RECOVER-UPDATE message.  The message
      includes parameters such as the session ID, message type, the hash
      of the previous message, the list of log messages that the
      recovered gateway needs to update, and the sender's digital
      signature.

   *  RECOVER-SUCCESS: The recovered gateway responds with a RECOVER-
      SUCCESS message if its logs have been successfully updated.  If
      there are inconsistencies detected, the recovered gateway
      initiates a dispute with a RECOVER-DISPUTE message.  The message
      parameters include session ID, message type, the hash of the
      previous message, a boolean indicating success, a list of hashes
      of log entries that were appended to the recovered gateway log,
      and the sender's digital signature.

   In case the recovery procedure has failed and a rollback process is
   needed, the following messages are used:

   *  ROLLBACK: A gateway that initiates a rollback sends a ROLLBACK
      message.  The message parameters include session ID, message type,
      a boolean indicating success, a list of actions performed to
      rollback a state (e.g., UNLOCK, BURN), a list of proofs specific
      to the DLT, and the sender's digital signature.

   *  ROLLBACK-ACK: Upon successful rollback, the counterparty gateway
      sends a ROLLBACK-ACK message to the recovered gateway
      acknowledging that the rollback has been performed successfully.
      The message parameters are similar to those of the ROLLBACK
      message.

12.  Error Messages

   SATP distinguishes between session termination initiated by the user
   at the application layer from session termination cased by errors at
   the SATP protocol layer.

   A gateway can transmit an error message at any point in the SATP
   protocol flow to its peer gateway.

   The default action to be taken by the transitting gateway is to
   terminate the session immediately.

   Error messages at the SATP protocol layer is distinct from time-outs
   due to gateway crashes.

12.1.  Session Termination Notification

   Session closure initiated at the application layer is not considered
   to be an error at the SATP protocol layer.

   The message type used for application-initiated session termination:
   session-abort-msg.

   The message type used to indicate protocols errors: error-msg.

   A gateway can transmit the session abort message at any point in the
   SATP protocol flow.  No further messages will be sent by the gateway.

   Any data received after the session termination message MUST be
   ignored.

12.2.  Connection Errors

   Errors may occur at the connection layer, independent of the flows at
   the SATP layer and errors there.

   (a) connectionError: There is an error in the TLS session
   establishment (TLS error codes should be reported-up to the gateway
   level)

   (b) badCertificate: The gateway TLS certificate was corrupt,
   contained signatures, that did not verify correctly, etc.  (Some
   common TLS level errors: unsupported_certificate,
   certificate_revoked, certificate_expired, certificate_unknown,
   unknown_ca).

   Connection errors resuting in the time-out of the session SHOULD
   result in the termination of the transfer session.

12.3.  SATP Protocol Errors

   The errors at the SATP level pertain to protocol flow and the
   information carried within each message.  These are enumerated in the
   appendix.

12.4.  Effectiveness of Session Aborts

   The effectiveness of a session-abort message on the state of the
   asset depends on where the abort message occurs in the SATP protocol
   flow in Figure 2.

   Note that a session-abort message by be lost and never be received by
   the peer gateway.  Gateways can crash prior to receiving an abort
   message.

   If gateway G2 transmits a session-abort message after gateway G1
   performs a lock (msgtype:lock-assert-msg) on the asset in network
   NW1, the gateway G1 can always unlock the asset and restore its
   state.

   If either gateway G1 or gateway G2 transmits a session-abort message
   after gateway G1 sends a lock-assert message (msgtype:lock-assert-
   msg) but before G2 sends the commit ready message (msgtype:commit-
   ready-msg), the gateway G1 can always unlock the asset and restore
   its state in network NW1.

   Similarly, if either gateway G1 or gateway G2 transmits a session-
   abort message immediately after gateway G1 sends a commit-prepare
   message (msgtype:commit-prepare-msg) but before G2 sends the commit
   ready message (msgtype:commit-ready-msg), the gateway G2 can always
   reverse the changes made by G2 to NW2 (i.e. reverse the assignment-
   to-self of the minted asset).

   However, an abort message (occurring in either direction) after
   gateway G1 transmits the commit final message (msgtype:commit-final-
   msg) will not be effective.  This is because G1 has already burned
   the asset in NW1 and G2 has already minted the asset in NW2 and has
   legally agreed to assign the asset to the appropriate beneficiary in
   NW2.

   In general, the termination of sessions or aborts occurring before
   the sender gateway G1 disables (burns) the asset in NW1 (in flow 3.4
   in Figure 2) will incur a minimal cost in terms of computing
   resources or fees on the part of both gateways G1 and G2.

13.  Security Consideration

   Gateways may be of interest to attackers because they enable the
   transferal of digital assets across networks and therefore are an
   important function in the digital economy.

   *  Disruptions in transfers and denial of service: Disruptions to a
      transfer session may cause not only resource waste (e.g. CPU
      usage), but in some cases may result in financial loss on the part
      of the gateway operator (e.g. fees charged by network).  Denial-
      of-service attacks by third parties to a run of the protocol may
      result in the termination of the current run (e.g. time-outs at
      the SATP layer), and for new attempts to be conducted.  If the
      gateway selection mechanisms are utilized by networks NW1 and NW2,
      such attacks may incur more delays because new gateways may have
      to be elected at either network.

   *  Dishonest gateways: The SATP protocol requires gateways to sign
      messages related to the transfer layer, not only to provide
      message source authentication and integrity but also to maintain
      honesty on the part of the gateways.  Gateway-operators may take-
      on legal and financial liabilities in certain jurisdictions by
      digitally signing messages.  Dishonest gateways may intentionally
      delay the delivery of certain messages or intentionally fail
      (abort) the protocol run at certain crucial points [ARCH].  Two
      such crucial points in the message flows are the following: (i)
      the commit-final-msg, where the sender G1 asserts it has
      extinguished (burned) the asset in the origin network, and (ii)
      the ack-prepare-msg where the receiver gateway G2 asserts it is
      ready to proceed with the final commitment.  If gateway G1
      intentionally drops the commit-final-msg (commit-final) such that
      gateway G2 times-out, then G2 may suffer financial loss due to
      roll-back costs in network NW2.  Similarly, if G2 intentionally
      drops the ack-prepare-msg to signal that it is ready to proceed
      with the commitment (commit-ready), then gateway G1 may time-out
      and terminate the protocol run, causing resource waste at G1.
      Operators of gateways should utlize relevant tools to detect
      possible dishonest behavior of certain gateways, and select to
      have their gateways peer with other reliable gateways.

   *  Protection of gateway keys: It is crucial to protect the
      cryptographic keys utilized by gateways.  This includes keys for
      secure session establishment (TLS1.3) and keys utilized for
      signing SATP messages.  Loss of gateway keys may incur financial
      loss on the part of the gateway-operator.  Implementation of
      gateways should consider utilizing tamper-resistant hardware to
      store and manage the relevant keys for gateways operational
      functions.

   *  Gateway identification: Mechanisms must be utilized to provide
      unique identifiers to gateway implementations to ensure global
      uniqueness and reachability.  Existing identification mechanisms
      such a X509 certificates and Verifiable Credentials (VC) and
      Selective Disclosure CBOR Web Tokens (SD-CWT) may be applied for
      gateway identification.

   *  Identification of networks: There needs to be mechanism for
      gateways to declare or disclose the asset networks it current
      serves.  Combined with strong gateway identification, this allows
      remote gateways to quickly locate suitable gateways to peer with
      for the purposes of asset transfers.
